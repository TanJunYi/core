__IRext is an open source Infra Red Remote Control library with encoding and decoding algorithm and remote control databases__

With IRext, you can easily get extremely compressed remote control code from web API and decode it in various environment including embedded devices, mobile phones, PC or even in your cloud servers.


### Features :
- All the remote control codes are well verified and extremely compressed with encoding and zipping algorithm.
- IRext provides a set of universary decoding algorithm for 38KHz IR wave code.
- Users can deploy private web console for IR remote code management.
- Users can upload, verify and release IR code with private web console.
- IRext encoding compresses millions bytes of IR remote code into files within hundreds bytes.
- IRext provides a set of computing-resource optimized decoding algorithm for embedded devices and OS, only consume 15KB RAM at most.
- 14 categories of home appliances are supoorted (AC, TV, TOP Set, Net Box, IPTV, Stereo, Projector, Fan, Cleaning Robot, Air Cleaner, Light Bulb, DVD, Branded TOP Box and Dyson series).
- Support up to 10000 types of remote controls.
- Support various types of devices and OS (SCM, Linux, Windows, Java Web, Android, RaspBerry Pi, Aduino, etc.).
- IRext privides examples for various platforms above.
- Support decoding online (public web console) and decoding online with evaluation boards.
- Support offline IR codes and databases, updating monthly.
